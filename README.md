by Michael Ivanitskiy, Aakash Patel, Connor Puritz

originally final project for the class Computational and Mathematical Neuroscience (Math 568), fall 2019 semester, University of Michigan

allows for the simulation of the growth of axons based on chemical gradients. Includes a basic form of activity-dependent signal release.
